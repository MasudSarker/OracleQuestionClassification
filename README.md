# Stack Overflow Oracle Question Classification using Machine Learning 

Out project Title:Stack overflow oracle error question classification based frequency using supervised machine learning

Our Project Steps:
1. Create dataset from stack overflow
2. Create a rule based on the rule manually classify error messages
3. We devide error question into two classes (Ex. Common error, Uncommon error)
4. Evaluate different machine learning to performance analysis
5. Analysis the result
