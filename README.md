# Stack Overflow Oracle Question Classification using Machine Learning 

Out project Title:Stack overflow oracle error question classification based frequency using supervised machine learning

Our Project Steps:
1. Create dataset from stack overflow
2. Create a rule for manually classify error
3. We devide error question class into two classes (Ex. Common error, Uncommon error)
4. Evaluate different machine learning to performance analysis
